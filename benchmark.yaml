# This defines a set of test
# The script will attempt to change maximum one parameter of these
# and run the tests.
# So, for example specifying
#   path1:
#   - a
#   - b
#   - c
#   path2:
#   - 1
#   - 2
# Will try with:
#   path1 = a, path2 = 1
#   path1 = a, path2 = 2
#   path1 = b, path2 = 1
#   path1 = c, path2 = 1
