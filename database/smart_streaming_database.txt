How experiments are stored
==========================

A database format was choosen.

A database allows quick filtering on data in multiple ways.

Postgres was choosen for the easy availability on Linux and as it's pretty powerful,
also is already used in RedMine, allowing to share the knowledge.

I'd try to stick to standard SQL features although the DDL (Data Definition Language)
will be pretty dependent on the database chosed.
The DDL, so the structure of the database is specified in a SQL script file,
and documented there with comments.
Although recent databases allows to store data in XML or JSON format I decided to
stick to a more "classic" structured way that allows database to quick manage data
and prevent user to insert into the database any possible combination of imaginable
format keeping data more consistent.

The various logs will be parsed and inserted in the database.
This will prevent keeping different kind of log and make sure data are consistent.
Potentially I see Python scripts doing the parsing and inserting of the
data into the database, this to allows flexibility (logs tends to quickly
evolve and we don't need performance).

Each experiments can have attached data to it to better represent the experiment.
For instance output of command like "rpm -qa" can be kept for future reference.

For consistency with timing you are supposed to save logs with clock time (in
unix gettimeofday or clock_gettime(CLOCK_REALTIME)). You are however not
supposed to sync the time between the machines in an absolute precision,
I expect second precision so keep in mind setting machines and doing
computations (difference between a server time and a guest or client time
is not expected to have much meaning, surely not sub-second precision).
